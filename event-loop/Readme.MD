Key Points:
Phases of the Event Loop:

Timers: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout and setInterval.
I/O Callbacks: Executes I/O-related callbacks that are deferred (excluding close callbacks, timers, or setImmediate).
Idle, Prepare: Internal phase for the system (not commonly used in applications).
Poll: Retrieves new I/O events and executes I/O callbacks.
Check: Executes setImmediate callbacks.
Close Callbacks: Handles cleanup for closed connections (e.g., socket.on('close')).
Event Queue:

Incoming asynchronous tasks are pushed into different queues, each tied to a specific phase of the loop.
Execution Flow:

The event loop continuously cycles through these phases, executing tasks in the respective queue.
Tasks like file reads, network requests, or timers are offloaded to the system/kernel, which notifies Node.js when the operation is complete.
Blocking vs Non-blocking:

Blocking code (like synchronous functions) halts the loop, preventing other tasks from executing.
Non-blocking asynchronous functions ensure smooth execution of multiple tasks.
Microtasks and Macrotasks:

Microtasks: Executed immediately after the current operation (e.g., process.nextTick and Promise callbacks).
Macrotasks: Scheduled within the phases of the event loop (e.g., setTimeout, setImmediate).
By managing tasks in phases and prioritizing microtasks, Node.js ensures an efficient, responsive, and non-blocking execution model.
